            We value simplicity and privacy: if we don’t need something, we don’t collect it. Any data we do hold is handled with care and never misused.

          <p>
            We collect information only for valid reasons: verifying your age, ensuring secure transactions, preventing fraud, and meeting our legal obligations.
            This data also helps us confirm that all users are eligible Australians and allows us to keep you informed of any important updates or notifications.
            All information is handled under Australian privacy law and is never shared for marketing without your permission.

          <p>
            Occasionally, we may share your information with trusted partners — such as licensed lottery providers, payment processors, or government agencies — but only when required by law or to process your requests.
            We never sell your data or share it with marketing agencies. If a third party asks to "buy a list", we politely decline every time.
            We always prioritise your privacy and only disclose data for genuine, lawful reasons.
