          <strong class="uppercase text-[#C9A66B]">Understanding Cookies</strong><br>
          Cookies aren’t a treat — they’re small files your browser saves when you use our site. These help us remember your choices, keep you logged in, and deliver a reliable experience. Without them, your session might reset or preferences may be lost. Cookies keep things easy and frustration-free, with no risk to your privacy.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong class="uppercase text-[#C9A66B]">Types We Use</strong><br>
          We use different cookies for different reasons. Some are essential for things like logins and keeping your account secure. Others help us learn which features people enjoy most, all without collecting personal info. Preference cookies remember your settings, and optional marketing cookies are disabled unless you approve. You decide what’s active.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong class="uppercase text-[#C9A66B]">No Unwanted Ads</strong><br>
          We don’t chase you with ads or hidden trackers. Any promotions you see here are always upfront and only appear with your consent. We avoid pop-ups and respect your time — you’ll never be followed around the web by our banners.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong class="uppercase text-[#C9A66B]">You’re In Control</strong><br>
          You choose how cookies are used. Accept, reject, or tweak your preferences at any time using our banner or your browser’s settings. You can change your mind whenever you like — your data, your rules. Nothing gets stored unless you’re happy with it.

          <strong class="uppercase text-[#C9A66B]">Our Privacy Commitment</strong><br>
          We comply with the Australian Privacy Act and draw from global standards like the GDPR. Every third-party service we use is checked for security and transparency. Partners don’t access your info unless you give permission. Keeping your data safe and private is non-negotiable.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong class="uppercase text-[#C9A66B]">How Long Cookies Stay</strong><br>
          Some cookies vanish when you close your browser; others stick around to keep your settings handy, but only with your OK. We don’t store anything longer than necessary, and you can clear or block cookies whenever you want. It’s all about your comfort.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong class="uppercase text-[#C9A66B]">Keeping You Updated</strong><br>
          Just as local rules can change, so might this cookie info. If we update our approach, we’ll let you know here. It’s a good idea to check back now and then for the latest details on how cookies are used to improve your experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong class="uppercase text-[#C9A66B]">Third-Party Services</strong><br>
          Sometimes we rely on trusted partners — like analytics or embedded tools — to make the site work better. These services may use their own cookies for performance or features, but never for collecting your personal data unless you approve. All tools meet Australian privacy requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong class="uppercase text-[#C9A66B]">Simple, Anonymous Analytics</strong><br>
          We gather anonymous stats to see what works, like which pages are most popular. This helps us improve the site — never to identify you. We never sell or trade your data, ever.
