        <p>
          Access to this platform is limited to individuals residing in Australia who are 18 years of age or older. Verification of both age and residency is required through approved identification. We may request proof at any stage to uphold these standards. Submitting incorrect or misleading details will result in immediate suspension or closure of your account.

      <div>
        <h2 class="text-lg font-bold uppercase mb-2 text-[#186A3B]">2. Our Role</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>[CURRENT_DOMAIN_NO_TLD]</strong> enables secure and transparent digital access to licensed Australian lottery services. We do not organise or manage lottery draws ourselves, nor do we publish results. Think of us as your direct line to officially sanctioned lottery opportunities — not as the lottery operator.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2 class="text-lg font-bold uppercase mb-2 text-[#186A3B]">3. Responsible Participation</h2>
        <p>
          We encourage everyone to view participation as a recreational activity. <strong>[CURRENT_DOMAIN_NO_TLD]</strong> fully supports the responsible gaming guidance of
          <a href="https://www.gambleaware.nsw.gov.au" target="_blank" class="underline text-[#186A3B] hover:text-[#C9A66B]">GambleAware NSW</a>
          and <a href="https://www.betstop.gov.au" target="_blank" class="underline text-[#186A3B] hover:text-[#C9A66B]">BetStop</a>. Setting limits, managing your time, and knowing when to take a pause are all strongly advised. Confidential support is available at all times.

        <h2 class="text-lg font-bold uppercase mb-2 text-[#186A3B]">4. Account Security & Safety</h2>
        <p>

      <div>
        <h2 class="text-lg font-bold uppercase mb-2 text-[#186A3B]">5. Prize Collection</h2>
        <p>
          All prize payouts are administered by the respective official lottery operator, not by <strong>[CURRENT_DOMAIN_NO_TLD]</strong>. We will notify you and offer clear guidance for prize claims, but we do not alter draw results or process payments ourselves. Payments are always subject to Australian law and the terms set by the lottery operator.
