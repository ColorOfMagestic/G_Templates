        At <strong>[CURRENT_DOMAIN_NO_TLD]</strong>, we believe every lottery entry should bring a little enjoyment—never anxiety. Just like a quiet Sunday puzzle or a stroll through Canberra’s parks, your experience should feel relaxed and under your control. Playing is about enjoyment, not chasing results.
      </p>

      <p>
        To support this, we provide practical tools that help you stay in charge. Pause your account at any time, take breaks as needed, review your play history, or set personal limits with just a few clicks—no complicated steps, no surprises.
      </p>

      <p>
        Please keep in mind: lottery outcomes are always random. Winning is never guaranteed and should not be expected as a source of income. The best approach is to treat play as light-hearted entertainment and nothing more.
      </p>

      <p>
