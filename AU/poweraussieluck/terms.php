          Our platform is intended solely for lawful participation in official lottery draws. Any use for fraudulent purposes or by automated systems is strictly prohibited. We reserve the right to suspend access if misuse is suspected.
          Users must act in good faith and not attempt to manipulate or interfere with draw outcomes.

        <p>
          All transactions are final and subject to confirmation. Please ensure your details are accurate before proceeding to checkout. Tickets cannot be amended, transferred, or cancelled unless required by Australian consumer law.
          Upon successful purchase, you will receive a confirmation via email or in your account dashboard. It is your responsibility to double-check the selected numbers and draw details. We do not take responsibility for errors made by the user during submission.

          If you win, funds are returned to the same account used for payment, pending verification. We may require identification in accordance with the <strong>Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (Cth)</strong>.
          Payouts are processed within a reasonable timeframe, typically 1–3 business days. We reserve the right to delay payment in cases of suspicious activity or incomplete verification. All winnings are subject to compliance with applicable tax and financial reporting obligations.
