        <p>
          At <strong>[CURRENT_DOMAIN_NO_TLD]</strong>, we believe lottery participation should be enjoyable, voluntary, and secure. We strictly follow all federal and state guidelines, including the National Consumer Protection Framework, to promote responsible play.
          Our policies are centred on fairness, informed choice, and access to support for all users. We design our platform with safety features that help prevent problematic behaviour and prioritise long-term community trust.

      <div>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#FF6F3C] mb-2">2. Age Restrictions</h2>
        <p>
          Access to our platform is restricted to individuals aged 18 or older. We apply age verification checks and may request additional proof if underage use is suspected. We do not market our services to minors under any circumstances.
          Our systems are regularly audited to prevent age fraud, and we actively monitor for suspicious activity. Any attempts to bypass age checks will result in account suspension or permanent exclusion.
        </p>

      <div>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#FF6F3C] mb-2">3. Play Responsibly</h2>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mt-2">
          <li>Set personal time and spending limits to avoid over-involvement</li>
          <li>Avoid chasing losses or making up for past draws — each draw is independent</li>
          <li>Only play with funds you can afford to lose, never borrow or use essential savings</li>
          <li>Understand that winning is never guaranteed and is based on chance alone</li>
          <li>Balance lottery play with other healthy activities like social time, work, and rest</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mt-4">
          Practicing moderation is key. Our tools and messaging are designed to encourage balanced habits and help users maintain control over their participation.

        <p>
          If you need a break or feel your play is becoming harmful, self-exclusion options are available. We encourage use of national and state-level support programs:
        </p>

      <div>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#FF6F3C] mb-2">5. Advertising Ethics</h2>
        <p>
          We do not encourage excessive play, unrealistic expectations, or urgency-based messaging. Our communications comply with the Advertising Code for Wagering and are designed for informational purposes only. Vulnerable or excluded individuals are not targeted.
          All promotional content is reviewed to avoid glamorising wins or suggesting lottery participation as a financial solution. We aim for honesty, transparency, and respect in every campaign.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#FF6F3C] mb-2">6. Personal Information & Privacy</h2>
        <p>
          All customer data is handled in accordance with the Australian Privacy Act 1988. We never use personal information to profile gambling behaviour or push targeted promotions. Your privacy matters — always.
          Data collected is used solely for operational and compliance purposes. Users can request access to or deletion of their data at any time by contacting our privacy officer.

      <div>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#FF6F3C] mb-2">7. Player Notifications</h2>
        <p>
          Participants may receive reminders about their entries, upcoming draws, or safer play resources. You can manage notification preferences at any time, and unsubscribe links are available in every message.
          We respect your inbox — all communications include clear unsubscribe options, and no unnecessary marketing is sent without permission. Notifications are opt-in and designed to help, not pressure.

      <div>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#FF6F3C] mb-2">8. Working With At-Risk Groups</h2>
        <p>
          We understand that certain individuals may be more vulnerable to gambling-related harm. We work to recognise signs of risky behaviour and provide pathways to early support — both online and via referrals to qualified external services.
          We also collaborate with support organisations to ensure our platform remains inclusive and adaptable for individuals experiencing financial hardship, isolation, or mental health challenges.
        </p>

      <div>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#FF6F3C] mb-2">9. Staff Training & Compliance</h2>
        <p>
          All customer-facing team members are trained in the principles of responsible gambling and digital safety. Ongoing training ensures we uphold a culture of care and comply with evolving regulations across all Australian jurisdictions.
          This includes awareness of red flags, escalation procedures, and understanding how to assist users who may be at risk. Our team is here to help — not to judge or dismiss concerns.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#FF6F3C] mb-2">10. Continuous Improvement</h2>
        <p>
          We review our responsible gambling framework regularly. Feedback, new legislation, and stakeholder consultation help us improve features, language, and accessibility to maintain safe participation across the board.
          If you have suggestions or concerns, we encourage you to share them. We value user input and use it to guide future updates to ensure we meet the highest standards of safety and inclusion.
