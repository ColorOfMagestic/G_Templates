            No account is needed. Just choose your draw, add a ticket to the cart, and make a secure payment. 
            We’ll email your confirmation and ticket without asking for passwords or personal login. 
            It’s fast, private, and perfect for Aussies who prefer to skip the usual signup steps.

            If you win, we’ll send an instant email to let you know. No need to check manually — but results are also posted on our homepage. 
            You’ll always be notified promptly and transparently, with no missed chances or delays. 
            Winnings are processed through secure, local systems.

          <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed text-[#1C1B1F]/80">
            Unfortunately, all ticket sales are final once payment is confirmed. 
            Because draws operate on strict schedules, cancellations or refunds are not available after purchase. 
            Please double-check your selection before completing payment — we’re here to assist if you need help beforehand.
