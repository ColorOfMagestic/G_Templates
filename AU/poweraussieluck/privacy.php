        <p>
          We may share your data with trusted service providers (e.g. payment processors, ID verification platforms) who are bound by privacy and data protection standards. We do not sell personal information to third parties.

          We retain your information only as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes it was collected for — including compliance, dispute resolution, or applicable law. After this, your data is securely deleted or anonymised.
          Data retention periods vary depending on the type of information and our legal obligations. Where possible, we use anonymisation techniques to limit retention risks.

          These safeguards may include contractual clauses, security certifications, or local privacy frameworks equivalent to those in Australia.
