        <p><strong class=" uppercase">What Are Cookies?</strong><br>
          No, not the edible ones. Cookies are tiny text files your browser saves when you visit a website. They help
          our site recognise returning visitors, keep track of preferences, and maintain a seamless browsing experience.
          Think of them as your digital footprint — handy for keeping things running smoothly. Without them, you might
          lose your picks or have to log in over and over again. They're safe, light, and make your time with us easier.
        </p>

        <p><strong class=" uppercase">Our Cookie Toolbox</strong><br>
          We use a few types of cookies, each with a specific job. Essential cookies make sure things like login and
          security features work properly. Performance cookies help us see what pages Aussies like most — no names, just
          numbers. Preference cookies remember small things like your favourite numbers or draw settings. And marketing
          cookies? They’re turned off by default and only switched on if you say “yep.”
        </p>
        <p><strong class=" uppercase">We Don’t Do Sneaky Ads</strong><br>
          You won’t find retargeting ads chasing you around the internet after visiting us. If we ever run promos,
          they’ll be clear, fair, and based only on your consent. No hidden tracking, no shady pop-ups. We respect your
          time — and your browser — too much for that.
        </p>

        <p><strong class=" uppercase">Your Say Matters</strong><br>
          You’ve got full control over cookies here — just like you do over your own bikkies at home. You can accept,
          reject, or adjust your cookie choices via our banner or straight from your browser settings. Changing your
          mind later? No stress — updates can be made anytime. We won’t collect anything sneaky or store info without
          your green light. It’s your data, and you’re in the driver’s seat.
        </p>

      <!-- Column 2 -->
      <div class="space-y-8">
        <p><strong class=" uppercase">Privacy Promises</strong><br>
          We stick to the Australian Privacy Act and take cues from global best practices like the GDPR. Every external
          service we work with is vetted for transparency, data safety, and fairness. They don’t access your private
          info unless you’ve ticked that box yourself. We’re serious about protecting your personal details — no
          shortcuts, no loopholes. Your trust means everything.
        </p>

        <p><strong class=" uppercase">Cookie Lifespan</strong><br>
          Some cookies disappear when you close your browser — like a chalkboard wiped clean. Others might hang around
          to remember your settings, but only if you’re cool with that. We never keep data longer than needed, and you
          can clear or block cookies whenever it suits you. It’s all about making things easier without sticking our
          nose where it doesn’t belong.
        </p>

        <p><strong class=" uppercase">Stay Informed</strong><br>
          Just like local notices on the community board, this cookie info might get updated from time to time. We’ll
          always do our best to let you know when that happens. It’s worth checking in now and then to stay across how
          we’re using technology to improve your lottery experience. Safe, fair, and no surprises — that’s our promise.
          If there’s anything unclear, we’re just a message away.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="space-y-8">
        <p><strong class=" uppercase">Third-Party Tools</strong><br>
          Sometimes we use trusted third-party services — like analytics or embedded content — to improve how the site
          runs. These partners may use their own cookies to measure performance or deliver features, but they’re not
          allowed to collect anything personal without your okay. Everything’s checked to meet Aussie privacy rules, and
          we keep it all as local and transparent as a cuppa on the porch.
        </p>

        <p><strong class=" uppercase">Analytics Without the Fuss</strong><br>
          We rely on simple stats to understand what works — like which pages are popular, or where folks tend to drop
          off. This helps us fine-tune your experience without needing to know your name or who you barrack for. The
          data’s anonymised and never sold or shared. It's like a scoreboard — useful, but not personal.
