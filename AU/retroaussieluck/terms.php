      <p><strong>1. Who May Participate:</strong> This platform is open exclusively to Australian residents aged 18 years or older. Age and location must be verified through official means before an account is granted. We may request documentation if there’s doubt or discrepancy. Users found falsifying information will have their accounts suspended or terminated. This ensures fairness and compliance with Australian gaming laws. No exceptions — ever.</p>

      <p><strong>2. What We Do (and Don’t):</strong> [CURRENT_DOMAIN_NO_TLD] is a digital access platform, meaning we help you engage with licensed lottery providers — securely and conveniently. We do not organise, host, or conduct the draws themselves, nor do we issue winning numbers. We are a gateway, not a game host. Our mission is to simplify participation while ensuring transparency and player protection. Think of us as a digital newspaper stand — we don’t print the headlines, we just help you reach them faster.</p>

      <p><strong>3. A Word on Responsibility:</strong> Participation in any lottery should be light-hearted and balanced. We are fully aligned with responsible gaming principles endorsed by <a href="https://www.gambleaware.nsw.gov.au" target="_blank" class="underline text-[#2E7D32] hover:text-[#66BB6A]">GambleAware NSW</a> and the <a href="https://www.betstop.gov.au" target="_blank" class="underline text-[#2E7D32] hover:text-[#66BB6A]">BetStop Register</a>. Users are encouraged to set limits, track their activity, and take breaks when needed. Support services are available 24/7 and are completely confidential. Your wellbeing is more important than any prize — and always will be.</p>

      <p><strong>4. Keeping Your Account Safe:</strong> Protecting your account is a shared responsibility. Choose a strong password, enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), and never share login credentials with others — not even mates. Our system monitors for unusual activity and alerts you to anything suspicious. If you suspect your account has been compromised, contact support immediately so we can investigate and secure your profile. Staying vigilant ensures your participation remains private, safe, and fair.</p>

      <p><strong>5. About the Winnings:</strong> Winnings are processed and disbursed by the official lottery operator, not [CURRENT_DOMAIN_NO_TLD] itself. We serve as a notification and access point — you’ll receive alerts and clear instructions if your ticket wins. Our role is to ensure timely, verified communication between you and the licensed operator. We never alter results, and we can’t expedite payouts beyond the provider’s official processing times. All prize distributions are subject to applicable Australian laws and eligibility rules.</p>

      <p><strong>6. Hands Off Our Content:</strong> All elements of this platform — from its design and layout to text, graphics, and brand assets — are copyright-protected under Australian IP law. You are welcome to read, browse, and enjoy, but you may not copy, modify, publish, or redistribute anything without our written consent. We actively monitor for unauthorised use and take infringement seriously. Using our materials without permission may result in legal action. Let’s keep it fair and original — the Aussie way.</p>

      <p><strong>7. Tech Troubles & Liability:</strong> We strive for uninterrupted access, but technology isn’t perfect. Sometimes servers fail, maintenance is needed, or external issues like ISP outages or natural events (yes, even rogue kangaroos) disrupt service. While we do everything possible to keep the lights on, we are not liable for any damages arising from downtime, delays, or errors outside our control. Use the platform with realistic expectations, and always keep personal backups of important activity or receipts.</p>

      <p><strong>8. When We Update:</strong> Laws and best practices evolve — and so do our terms. We reserve the right to update these Terms & Conditions at any time, with or without notice. The current version will always be posted here for review. Continued use of the site means you accept the latest terms. We recommend checking back occasionally, especially if something doesn’t feel clear or if you've been away for a while.</p>

      <p><strong>9. Questions? We’re Listening:</strong> We welcome feedback, questions, or clarification requests. Email us directly at <a href="mailto:privacy@[CURRENT_DOMAIN_NO_TLD].com" class="underline text-[#2E7D32] hover:text-[#66BB6A]">privacy@[CURRENT_DOMAIN_NO_TLD].com</a>, or use our secure contact form. Our support team typically replies within 1–2 business days. In urgent cases, we prioritise user safety and platform access first. Your voice matters — and we read every message.</p>

      <p><strong>10. Governing Law:</strong> This website and its use are governed by the laws of New South Wales and the Commonwealth of Australia. Any disputes or legal matters shall be handled through proper Australian legal channels. We work closely with regulatory bodies and comply fully with all local gaming and consumer laws. Our legal desk reviews all platform changes to ensure ongoing alignment with the letter and spirit of Australian regulation.</p>
