          <p>
            When you join <strong>[CURRENT_DOMAIN_NO_TLD]</strong>, we collect a few basics to make the platform work: your name, contact details, device information, and what you do on-site.
            We use this data to help you play securely and legally. No sneaky surveillance, no unnecessary data hoarding.
            What we don’t need, we don’t collect. And everything we do hold is treated with the kind of care usually reserved for grandma’s biscuit tin.

          <p>
            Cookies are tiny digital bikkies that help us remember your settings, keep you logged in, and deliver a smooth browsing experience.
            Some are essential, while others (like preference cookies) make life easier. You can manage cookie preferences at any time — either via browser settings or our banner.
            Nothing gets stored without purpose. For a full breakdown, check out our <a href="/cookies" class="underline text-[#2E7D32] hover:text-[#66BB6A]">Cookie Policy</a>.

          <h2 class="font-bold uppercase mb-2 text-sm">Your Say</h2>
          <p>
            You’ve got rights, and we respect them. Want to check what we know about you? Change something? Delete it altogether?
            No drama — just shoot us an email at <a href="mailto:privacy@[CURRENT_DOMAIN_NO_TLD]" class="underline text-[#2E7D32] hover:text-[#66BB6A]">privacy@[CURRENT_DOMAIN_NO_TLD]</a>.
            We aim to respond promptly and clearly, without legal jargon or roundabout delays. Your data, your call.

          <h2 class="font-bold uppercase mb-2 text-sm">Shelf Life</h2>
          <p>
            We only keep your data for as long as we’re legally required — and no longer. If the law says we can delete it, we do.
            That includes expired accounts, inactive profiles, or closed memberships. Our deletion process is secure and permanent.
            Think of it like shredding — but digital.

          <h2 class="font-bold uppercase mb-2 text-sm">Why We Ask</h2>
          <p>
            We don’t ask for info unless there’s a good reason. Age verification, transaction security, fraud prevention, or ensuring fair access — that’s where it starts.
            The information helps us make sure only eligible Aussies participate. It also allows us to notify you of wins or critical platform updates.
            Everything is handled under Australian privacy law and never repurposed for marketing without your green light.

          <h2 class="font-bold uppercase mb-2 text-sm">Mates We Trust</h2>
          <p>
            Occasionally, we may need to pass your data along — but only to trusted partners and only when it’s absolutely necessary.
            That might include licensed lottery authorities, secure payment processors, or legal/government bodies if the situation calls for it.
            We never, ever sell your info to marketing firms or shady third parties. If someone wants to "buy a list", we send them packing.
            Our rule is simple: no sharing without a legal reason or your clear say-so.

        <div>
          <h2 class="font-bold uppercase mb-2 text-sm">Safe as a Bank Vault</h2>
          <p>
            Your personal data is stored on secure Australian servers with layers of encryption and constant security monitoring.
            We use multi-factor authentication, intrusion detection, and regular audits to keep everything tight.
            Access is limited to authorised team members only — no exceptions. We treat your data like it’s our own (and we’re fussy).
          </p>

        <div>
          <h2 class="font-bold uppercase mb-2 text-sm">We Obey the Rules</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>[CURRENT_DOMAIN_NO_TLD]</strong> follows the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) as set out by the OAIC.
            That means transparency, data minimisation, and clear processes if something ever goes wrong.
            We document our policies, audit regularly, and stay current with legislation — because privacy isn’t optional, it’s our responsibility.
