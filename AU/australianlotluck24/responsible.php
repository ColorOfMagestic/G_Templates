        <p>
          At <strong>[CURRENT_DOMAIN_NO_TLD]</strong>, we’re committed to ensuring that every lottery experience remains positive, voluntary, and fully secure. We operate in full compliance with all Australian federal and state regulations, including the National Consumer Protection Framework. Our platform is built to promote informed choices, offer practical safeguards, and provide access to support whenever needed.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#FFB300] mb-2">2. Age Limitations</h2>
        <p>
          Only individuals 18 and over are permitted to use our services. We conduct strict age checks and may request supporting documents if underage access is suspected. Services and advertising are never directed to minors. Our systems are routinely audited to prevent underage use, and any attempt to bypass these controls will result in immediate account exclusion.
        </p>

      <div>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#FFB300] mb-2">3. Principles for Responsible Play</h2>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mt-2">
          <li>Set clear limits on your playtime and spending</li>
          <li>Never attempt to recover losses through additional spending</li>
          <li>Only use discretionary funds, not money needed for essentials</li>
          <li>Remember that all draws are random — winning can never be promised</li>
          <li>Ensure that participation remains a fun, occasional activity, balanced with other aspects of life</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mt-4">
          We encourage moderation in all play. Helpful tools and clear reminders are built into our platform to empower players to stay in control.

      <div>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#FFB300] mb-2">4. Self-Exclusion and Help Resources</h2>
        <p>
          If you feel your play is becoming problematic or simply want to take a break, you can opt for self-exclusion at any time. We recommend these confidential, no-cost Australian resources:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mt-2">

      <div>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#FFB300] mb-2">5. Ethical Communications</h2>
        <p>
          We never use pressure tactics, misleading promises, or urgency in our messaging. Our communications follow the Advertising Code for Wagering and are only informational. We never target individuals with vulnerabilities or those who have excluded themselves from play.
          All marketing is reviewed for accuracy and sensitivity — we never promote lottery participation as a solution to personal or financial problems.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#FFB300] mb-2">6. Safeguarding Your Privacy</h2>
        <p>
          Personal data is handled in strict accordance with the Australian Privacy Act 1988. We never use your information to profile gambling behaviour or send targeted offers. Your privacy is a core value. Data collected is solely for service and regulatory reasons; you can access, amend, or delete your data at any time by contacting our privacy team.

          We send reminders only about your participation, upcoming draws, or support resources. You control notification settings and can unsubscribe at any moment. We avoid any unnecessary messages and always include clear opt-out options. All notifications are strictly opt-in and designed for your benefit.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#FFB300] mb-2">8. Support for Vulnerable Users</h2>
        <p>
          We recognise that some individuals may be at higher risk of gambling-related harm. We aim to identify risk signs and offer early pathways to help, including referrals to qualified support services. We partner with relevant organisations to ensure our platform remains accessible and inclusive for all, including those experiencing hardship or health challenges.
