        <p>
          Our website is exclusively for lawful participation in regulated lottery draws. Any attempt to use automated tools, act fraudulently, or disrupt fair play is not permitted.

        <p>
          All purchases are final once confirmed. Please carefully review your details and selections before payment. Once submitted, tickets cannot be changed, transferred, or cancelled except as allowed under Australian law. Confirmation of purchase will be sent to your email or shown in your dashboard. Always check your ticket and numbers thoroughly — we cannot accept responsibility for errors you make during entry.

        <p>
          Any winnings are paid to the same account used for your purchase, following successful verification.
