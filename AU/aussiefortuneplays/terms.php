Our platform is designed to simplify ticket management and provide transparency around results and prize claims.</p>

        <p>Winnings from eligible draws will be credited to your account wallet automatically where possible. For high-tier prizes or those exceeding jurisdictional thresholds, manual verification or direct collection from the official lottery body may be required. It is your responsibility to provide correct and up-to-date personal information to avoid payout delays. Withdrawal methods may vary depending on your bank or selected payment provider, and standard identification checks apply prior to processing significant amounts.</p>
