      <p><strong>1. Eligibility:</strong> Access to this platform is strictly limited to Australian residents aged 18 or over. Age and residency must be verified with official documentation before account activation. Any falsified details will lead to suspension or termination. These requirements ensure compliance with Australian gaming regulations — no exceptions.</p>

      <p><strong>2. Scope of Service:</strong> <strong>[CURRENT_DOMAIN_NO_TLD]</strong> provides secure, convenient digital access to licensed lottery operators. We do not organise, host, or conduct draws, and we do not generate winning numbers. Think of us as a safe gateway connecting you to official sources — we do not alter outcomes.</p>

      <p><strong>3. Responsible Participation:</strong> We follow harm‑minimisation principles endorsed by <a href="https://www.gambleaware.nsw.gov.au" target="_blank" class="underline text-[#00A3FF] hover:text-white">GambleAware NSW</a> and the <a href="https://www.betstop.gov.au" target="_blank" class="underline text-[#00A3FF] hover:text-white">BetStop Register</a>. Set limits, track your activity, and take breaks when needed. Support is free, confidential, and available 24/7 nationwide.</p>

      <p><strong>4. Account Security:</strong> Use strong passwords, enable two‑factor authentication, and never share your credentials. We actively monitor for unusual activity and will act immediately to secure accounts. Report any suspected compromise without delay.</p>

      <p><strong>5. Prize Claims:</strong> All prize claims and payments are handled by the official lottery operator, not <strong>[CURRENT_DOMAIN_NO_TLD]</strong>. We notify you of results and provide guidance through the operator’s official claim process — no alterations and no payout shortcuts.</p>

      <p><strong>6. Intellectual Property:</strong> All site content — including text, images, and design elements — is protected by copyright. Unauthorised reproduction or use is prohibited and may result in legal action.</p>

      <p><strong>7. Technical Limitations:</strong> While we strive for uninterrupted access, outages or external issues may occur. We are not liable for losses resulting from downtime. Please retain your own records of any important activity or confirmations.</p>

      <p><strong>8. Amendments:</strong> These terms may be updated at any time. The current version is always published on this page. Continued use of the platform constitutes acceptance of the latest terms.</p>

      <p><strong>9. Contact:</strong> For questions or concerns, email <a href="mailto:privacy@[CURRENT_DOMAIN_NO_TLD].com" class="underline text-[#00A3FF] hover:text-white">privacy@[CURRENT_DOMAIN_NO_TLD].com</a> or use our contact form. We aim to respond within 1–2 business days, prioritising safety and access issues.</p>

      <p><strong>10. Governing Law:</strong> These terms are governed by the laws of New South Wales and the Commonwealth of Australia. Disputes will be resolved through appropriate Australian legal channels in full compliance with applicable regulations.</p>
