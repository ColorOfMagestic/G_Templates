        At <strong>[CURRENT_DOMAIN_NO_TLD]</strong>, every ticket should bring lightness — not pressure. 
        Just like enjoying a weekend crossword or a quiet cup of tea, the lottery is about the moment, not the outcome.
      </p>

      <p>
        We’ve designed features that put you in control: pause play anytime, track your activity, and set clear limits. 
        No hidden catches, no push to keep going — your pace, your rules.
      </p>

      <p>
        Always remember: draws are random. Wins come by chance, not skill, and never define your worth.  
        Play for entertainment — it’s the only guaranteed way to win every time.
