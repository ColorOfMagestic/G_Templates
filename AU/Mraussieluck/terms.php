    <p>
      We provide fast and accurate lottery results for Australia’s PowerBall, Oz Lotto, Saturday Lotto, and other nationally recognised draws.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since launching, we’ve tracked and archived thousands of draws — processing tens of thousands of number combinations. At <strong>[CURRENT_DOMAIN_NO_TLD]</strong>, we use secure, up-to-date technology to deliver real-time access to both current and historical lottery outcomes in a clear, user-friendly format.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each result includes verified prize breakdowns, winner counts, jackpot totals, and the draw structure for full transparency. We aim to support informed, responsible participation — with no hidden conditions or misleading claims.
    </p>
    <p>
      While we do not operate or facilitate actual lottery entries, we offer independently maintained information services for informational and entertainment purposes only. All official lottery entries must be made through licensed and authorised operators within Australia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Access to this site is intended only for users aged 18 and over, and residing within Australia. By continuing to use <strong>[CURRENT_DOMAIN_NO_TLD]</strong>, you confirm that you meet these eligibility requirements and agree to our terms of use.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may update these terms periodically to reflect changes in services, legal obligations, or user feedback. Continued use of the platform indicates acceptance of any such updates.
