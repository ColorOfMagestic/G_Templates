      <p>Diese Allgemeinen Geschäftsbedingungen („AGB“) regeln das Verhältnis zwischen WHOW und natürlichen Personen
        (nachfolgend „Nutzer“), die Online-Spiele („Spiele“) oder andere damit verbundene Dienste in Anspruch nehmen.
        Hierzu zählen unter anderem das Anlegen von Profilseiten, die Teilnahme an Blogs und Foren, das Hochladen von
        Medien wie Fotos, Texten und Videos auf dem Portal sowie das Lizensieren virtueller Gegenstände, wie zum
        Beispiel virtueller Spielwährung, virtueller Güter, zusätzlicher Spielinhalte oder Content-Pakete (nachfolgend
        zusammenfassend als „virtuelle Gegenstände“ bezeichnet), sowie sonstige von WHOW angebotene Leistungen – gleich,
        ob im Internet („Web“), über mobile Anwendungen („Apps“) oder über andere Plattformen und Endgeräte.
        Wesentlicher Bestandteil der Nutzung dieses Portals, der virtuellen Gegenstände und Dienste (nachfolgend
        insgesamt als „Leistungen“ bezeichnet) sind neben diesen AGB auch die Datenschutzbestimmungen sowie das
        Impressum von WHOW.</p>

        Play, iTunes, Windows Store etc.) oder der Internetverbindung des Nutzers zu den angebotenen Diensten ergeben,

        Nutzung der angebotenen Leistungen ist nur dann zulässig, wenn dies nach der Rechtslage des Landes, in dem der
        Nutzer seinen Wohnsitz hat, oder dessen ständiger Aufenthalt sich befindet, oder an dem sich der Nutzer zum

B. Facebook Connect). WHOW behält sich das Recht vor, die Aktivierung eines Kontos von der Bestätigung eines Aktivierungslinks abhängig zu machen, der an die vom Nutzer angegebene E-Mail-Adresse gesendet wird.

Ein auf dem Portal erstellter Account gewährt dem Nutzer Zugang zu allen Diensten im Rahmen der Bedingungen gemäß Abschnitt 1.1.</p>

<p>1.2.6 Die Registrierung, also die Beantragung eines Accounts, erfolgt elektronisch durch Ausfüllen eines Formulars und Angabe der dort geforderten Daten. Die Nutzung der WHOW-Spiele und/oder -Dienste ist ab dem Zeitpunkt möglich, zu dem das Konto für den Nutzer von WHOW angelegt wurde.</p>

<p>1.2.7 Pro Nutzer ist nur ein Account auf dem Portal zulässig. WHOW behält sich das Recht vor, weitere Accounts des Nutzers als unzulässig zu sperren.</p>

<p>WHOW behält sich zudem das Recht vor, Nutzer teilweise oder vollständig vom Dienst auszuschließen, die Zahlungen stornieren oder fehlerhafte Zahlungsdaten angeben, vorsätzlich falsche Angaben bei der Registrierung machen, sich gegenüber anderen Nutzern, WHOW-Mitarbeitern oder WHOW selbst beleidigend, diffamierend, rassistisch oder anderweitig diskriminierend äußern – sei es im Chat, per E-Mail, in sozialen Medien oder auf sonstigen Wegen.

<p>1.2.14 Die Nutzung der Spiele in der jeweiligen Basisversion (Free2Play-Version) ist kostenlos. Bestimmte Funktionen stehen nur zahlenden Nutzern zur Verfügung (siehe Abschnitt 7). Die Nutzung der Dienste ist kostenfrei, sofern in der Beschreibung des jeweiligen Dienstes nichts anderes angegeben ist.</p>

<p>1.2.15 Der Nutzer hat keinen Anspruch darauf, die zum Zeitpunkt des Vertragsschlusses bestehende Version eines Dienstes, insbesondere eines Spiels oder sonstigen Angebots, dauerhaft zu behalten. WHOW behält sich das Recht vor, den Dienst insgesamt oder einzelne Spiele oder Dienste jederzeit und ohne Vorankündigung oder Angabe von Gründen einzustellen. In einem solchen Fall kann der Nutzer verlangen, dass im Voraus gezahlte Gebühren für fortlaufende Leistungen (z. B. virtuelle Gegenstände, Abonnements) erstattet werden, sofern WHOW die entsprechende Gegenleistung nicht erbracht hat. Das Recht gilt nicht für Gebühren für Einzelleistungen, die bereits vollständig erbracht wurden. Das Recht des Nutzers zur außerordentlichen Kündigung bleibt unberührt. Weitere Ansprüche des Nutzers sind ausgeschlossen, sofern in diesen AGB nicht ausdrücklich etwas anderes geregelt ist.</p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-[#FFCE00]">2. Conclusion of Contract for the Usage of the respective Portal</h3>

      <p>2.1 By filling in the registration form for the Account and the respective confirmation of the User that he/she
        has read through and taken notice of the Terms &amp; Conditions, the User enters into a binding agreement
        (hereinafter referred to as Contract) with WHOW for usage of the service provided at the portal. An acceptance
        by WHOW can take place expressly or via an initial act of fulfillment, i.e. granting the User access to the
        portal, but most certainly in that the User is provided with the Games or Services. A (license) acquisition of
        game software and/or individual elements is excluded unless or until otherwise explicitly stipulated. The user
        confirms that he/she has read the Terms &amp; Conditions via the Internet browser by checking the box and
        confirming the entry accordingly as part of the registration process. When using the Games and Services in an
        app, the User accepts the Term &amp; Conditions by downloading the respective app.</p>

      <p>2.2 The User’s own Terms &amp; Conditions are expressly not considered a part of the Contract agreement unless
        WHOW should, for its own reasons and of its own accord, expressly agree to them in written form.</p>

      <p>2.3 In as much as the establishment of an account is necessary in order to make use of Games or Services, WHOW
        shall promptly send a confirmation email acknowledging receipt of the User Application to the email address
        provided by the User at the time of registration. This acknowledgment of receipt does not represent a binding
        approval of the User Application. The acceptance of the User Application and the confirmation for accessing WHOW
        Games and Services can, however, be sent together with the acknowledgment email.</p>

          withdrawal period expires.</p>

        <p>C O N S E Q U E N C E S O F W I T H D R A W A L</p>

        <p>Should you choose to withdraw from the agreement, we will be responsible for reimbursing you for all payments
          that we will have received from you, including delivery costs (with the exception of additional costs that may
          result from you having chosen to make use of a form of delivery other than the most low-priced form of
          delivery we have offered you), immediately and at the latest within fourteen days of the date upon which the
          notification of your revocation of this agreement has reached us. For this reimbursement, we shall make use of
          the same form of payment that you used in the original transaction unless a common agreement on another form
          of payment is concluded explicitly with you. Under no circumstances shall you be charged with any
          reimbursement fees.</p>

        <h4>3.2 Premature Expiration of the Right of Withdrawal</h4>

        <p>In the case of an agreement on the delivery of digital content that is not stored on a physical data medium,
          your right to withdrawal expires prematurely if you have expressly consented to having us start to carry out
          the agreement before the period of withdrawal expires and you have confirmed acknowledgment that you gave your
          consent to waive your right to withdrawal once we begin carrying out this agreement.</p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-[#FFCE00]">4. Availability</h3>

      <p>WHOW guarantees that its Games and Services shall be available 90% (ninety percent) of the time on a yearly
        average. Excluded from this percentage are time periods in which WHOW portal servers, individual Games and/or
        Services are not available online due to technical or other problems which are outside the control of WHOW (such
        as force majeure, Third Party fault, etc.) as well as periods in which routine maintenance work is carried out.
        The liability of WHOW with regard to the inaccessibility of the Games and/or Services by intent and gross
        negligence remains unaffected. WHOW can restrict access to its Games and Services if required for network
        security and preservation of network integrity, especially with regards to the prevention of severe breakdowns
        or interruptions of the network, software, or stored data.</p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-[#FFCE00]">5. Access to these Terms &amp; Conditions, Changes and Further
        Notifications, Contact by the User</h3>

      <p>5.1 These Terms &amp; Conditions apply for each login to the Portal, especially when any of the WHOW Games
        and/or Services are used. The Terms &amp; Conditions can be printed out or saved by the User on digital media.
      </p>

      <p>5.2 WHOW reserves the right to change or amend these Terms &amp; Conditions with regard to future arrangements
        at any given time, provided this is deemed necessary and if the User is not put at a disadvantage in a breach of
        good faith. An amendment may prove to be necessary so as to (a) make adjustments to alterations in a given legal
        situation, for (b) changes in European or supreme court case law, due to (c) technical requirements, as to (d)
        maintain and ensure operations, to (e) take altering market conditions into consideration, (f) due to an
        expansion of the Services, and (g) for the benefit of the User.</p>

      <p>5.3 An amendment or supplement to these Terms and Conditions shall be announced no less than six weeks prior to
        the entry into force of such an amendment or supplement. This announcement shall be made in written form and in
        an appropriate manner. In general, information on such an amendment or supplement to the Terms &amp; Conditions
        shall be sent as a notification per email to the email address most recently supplied by the User or placed on
        the website featuring the Games and Service or right in the Games and Services themselves, but no later than in
        the form of a presented, highlighted announcement the next time the User logs in to his/her account
        (“Announcement”).</p>

      <p>5.4 The user has the right to object to an amendment or supplement to these Terms and Conditions vis-à-vis WHOW
        within six weeks after publication/announcement and the reasonable possibility of having noticed it. In the case
        of an objection made on time, both parties are entitled to terminate the agreement according to the provisions
        of termination in this agreement. Any and all other withdrawal/termination rights remain unaffected. Any payment
        made in advance of the withdrawal for virtual items or subscriptions that have not yet been credited or booked
        to the User’s account, much less already made use of by the User, which extend beyond the termination date,
        shall be reimbursed to the User on a pro rata basis. Further claims by the User are considered to hereby be
        invalid. Altered Terms &amp; Conditions take effect immediately as soon as the User has accepted these
        alterations. If the User does not object within the six-week deadline period after publication or access to the
        announcement about the alterations to these Terms &amp; Conditions in written or text form (i.e. per email or
        fax) or if he/she continues to make use of the Services thereafter, the alteration and/or amendment is deemed as
        having been accepted and becomes part of the agreement. The provisions in Section 5.1 apply mutatis mutandis.
      </p>

      <p>5.5 In the course of informing the User about such amendments or supplements, WHOW shall especially inform the
        User about the possibility of objecting to the changes and/or cancellation of Services as well as the deadline
        for doing so and the legal consequences, especially with regards to an objection that has failed to materialize.
      </p>

      <p>5.6 Unless otherwise stipulated in these Terms &amp; Conditions or in other agreements with the User, WHOW
        shall generally communicate with the User by email. The User shall ensure that he/she can receive all emails
        sent by WHOW to the address he/she submitted to WHOW at the time of registration and at subsequent times. He/she
        is responsible for settings and maintenance of the spam filter and for regularly checking all incoming email
        sent to this address. WHOW reserves the right to correspond with Users in whichever form of communication the
        company deems necessary.</p>

      <p>5.7 Upon contacting WHOW, the User shall indicate which Games and/or Services and which Game and/or Service
        Account his/her correspondence pertains to.</p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-[#FFCE00]">6. Instructions, Rules of the Games, Conditions of Participation</h3>

      <p>6.1 In addition to these Terms and Conditions, a separate set of rules and conditions of participation, which
        are made known to the User at an appropriate place in the portal, may apply for the respective game or the use
        of Services. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, should there be any contradictions between these Terms and
        Conditions and the rules of a game or conditions of participation, the conditions of these Terms and Conditions
        shall, in principle, apply in governing the circumstances that have given rise to the respective
        contradiction(s). For individual games, special variations and/or components of games, and individual services
        offered on the Portal, special terms of use may also apply. The User shall be informed in an appropriate manner
        before he/she chooses to make use of the respective offer.</p>

      <p>6.2 The User is consciously aware that he/she might play together with numerous other Users and that he/she
        communicates with other Users via the Portal. In order to ensure successful interaction between the Users in the
        Games, it is imperative that the rules are observed by all Users.</p>

      <p>6.3 The User shall, with regards to Section 6.2, also refrain from undertaking any other activity which could
        interfere with the normal operation of Games, the provision of the Services or which is disruptive to the
        successful interaction between Users.</p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-[#FFCE00]">7. Playing for Free, Fees, Payment Conditions, Late Payment</h3>

      <h4>7.1 Online Games</h4>

      <p>By receiving virtual objects, the User acquires a limited, non-transferable, revocable license to use these
        virtual items in the context of the online Games located on the portal.</p>

      <p>7.1.1 Use of Services (Free2Play model) free of charge</p>

      <p>In principle, WHOW provides Users with free Services in accordance to the Free2Play model as of the creation of
        a User Account (see Section 1.2 above). The Free2Play model enables the use of the portal and the availability
        of Games and Services, which are generally unlimited in terms of time and content. To make this possible, the
        User is provided with free virtual items right at the portal that can be obtained in regular intervals. However,
        in this Free2Play version, the User certainly may not find himself/herself with access to all features or
        in-game levels or Services right from the start.</p>

      <p>7.1.2 Additional virtual items</p>

      <p>The User has the option of receiving additional virtual items against payment of a fee. User who use the
        services exclusively free of charge (Free2Play model) that are not available in the basic version either
        immediately or certainly when, to a lesser extent. Additional virtual items can either promote or accelerate the
        individual game progress of the User or enable more individual game variations. Which or just how many virtual
        items are offered at which price or tariff, which functions they specifically have, and which exact uses they
        offer, can be found right in the portal or in the descriptions of the respective Games and/or game rules or
        respective conditions of participation. WHOW therefore reserves the right to offer new virtual items at any
        time. In the course of adapting and further developing our Games, WHOW also reserves the right to no longer
        offer individual virtual items. All prices for additional virtual items are gross prices, i.e. including any
        applicable taxes. The fee for ordering virtual objects is due immediately and must be paid in advance (see
        Section 7.1.4 below). Games are constantly being developed and while adapting and further developing our Games,
        WHOW also reserves the right to no longer offer individual Games or Services. Any service fees paid in advance
        over the termination period for virtual objects or subscriptions that have not yet been credited or booked to
        the User’s account or used by the User shall be reimbursed to the User on a pro-rata basis and thus, in this
        case, all further claims are excluded. In the case of permanent suspension of a Service or individual Games,
        Section 1.2.15 shall apply.</p>

      <p>7.1.3 Subscription/Automatic Renewal</p>

      <p>If payments for additional virtual items are to be made at regular intervals (i.e. daily, weekly, monthly,
        quarter yearly, half yearly, yearly, etc.), the User effectively enters into a subscription for these Premium
        Features that shall automatically be renewed if it is not cancelled in a timely manner by the User before the
        end of the set time limit as stipulated in Section 8.2 below. The subscription terms are described in the game
        rules and/or Conditions of Participation for the respective Games.</p>

      <p>7.1.4 Payment Conditions and Due Date of Payment</p>

      <p>WHOW is authorized to ask the User for advance payment for the use of additional virtual items (see Section
        7.1.2 above). Such payment shall be due upon conclusion of the agreement and shall, by choice of the User, be
        debited from the provided bank account or charged to the credit card account provided by the User, inasmuch as
        the User has not opted for another form of payment, for example, the payment methods offered in the portal. The
        amount to be collected shall be displayed on bills from payment providers or bank account statements with as
        booking text such as " WWW.WHOW.COM " or "WHOW ", "Jackpot", "MyJackpot", etc. The name or title may deviate
        when making use of alternative payment methods. If a payment should be made via a mobile telephony-supported
        payment method (i.e. Premium-SMS, Premium Call, Short Cods, etc.), the order and payment made by the owner of
        the mobile phone connection making use of the mobile phone application is deemed to be approved and having been
        initiated on behalf of the User, provided of course that the User and connection owners are different.</p>

      <p>7.1.5 Adjustment of Fees for virtual Items</p>

      <p>WHOW reserves the right to reduce or raise prices for all Services that do not represent a subscription (a
        continuing obligation) permanently or for a limited period of time or to offer new products, services or methods
        of payment at any time, either on a temporary or permanent basis. Until termination of the agreement, the
        original Terms &amp; Conditions shall remain in effect without prejudice to the rights of the User as per
        Section 8.2 and Section 8.3.</p>

      <p>7.1.6 Adjustments to Charges for Subscriptions</p>

      <p>WHOW is entitled to adjust the fees for the contractually agreed to services for continuing obligations as per
        the following conditions: A price alteration for subscriptions shall be announced to the User at least six weeks
        before its entry into force. As a rule, reference is made to the alterations/amendments to the fees for
        subscriptions in text form per email or per highlighted announcement right in the User account at the portal or
        on the website featuring the Games or in the Games themselves the next time the User logs in. The User has an
        extraordinary six-week right to object to the announced price change or terminate the agreement as of the date
        of the announcement of the price change. Any service fees possibly paid for virtual objects in advance (going
        beyond the time of the price change) that have not yet been credited or booked to the User’s account due to the
        subscription or used by the User shall be reimbursed to the User on a pro-rata basis. All further claims are
        then prohibited. WHOW shall indicate these rights in its announcement. If the User does not exercise this right
        within the respective time period, the price change is considered as being approved. Price reductions generally
        apply in principle as of the announced date for the next invoicing period.</p>

      <h4>7.2 Late Payment</h4>

      <p>In case of late payment, WHOW is authorized to charge interest set to the applicable legal lending rate in the
        EU. WHOW is also entitled to discontinue Services and to suspend the User’s Account(s) if payment is overdue.
        For the period of a suspension, no performance fee is payable for any closed subscriptions.</p>

      <h4>7.3 Direct Debit Reversals, Cancellation Fees</h4>

      <p>If WHOW incurs costs and/or losses or if WHOW is charged a cancellation fee due to a cancelled direct debit
        payment as a result of User fault or circumstances leading back to the User (for example, if the User does not
        have an adequate or sufficient account balance), the User shall bear all cancellation fees generated for WHOW as
        a result of these actions. WHOW is entitled to demand payment of the costs incurred from repeated attempts to
        debit the charges from the User’s account together with the original fees. The User is entitled to prove that no
        damage occurred or that a substantially lower level of damage was caused due to late payment.</p>

      <h4>7.4 No Guarantee of Prizes</h4>

      <p>Playing or purchasing virtual objects on or at the portal certainly does not constitute any intangible or
        tangible assets. As such, WHOW does not also guarantee any form of profits to Users. The portal is solely
        intended for entertainment purposes only. No prizes (cash prizes, etc.) shall be awarded.</p>

      <h4>7.5 No Set-off; No Right of Retention; No Cession</h4>

      <p>The User may only set off a claim by WHOW for outstanding accounts if his/her counterclaims cannot be disputed
        or have been declared legally binding. The User can only withhold payment if his/her counterclaim is related to
        the same Terms &amp; Conditions. The right of the User to assign his/her claims to a Third Party is invalid.</p>

      <h4>7.6 Services</h4>

      <p>Unless otherwise stipulated in the Service description, Services can be used free of charge. Furthermore,
        Sections 7.1 through 7.5 apply to fee-based Services.</p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-[#FFCE00]">8. Term, Cancellation</h3>

      <h4>8.1 Duration</h4>

      <p>All agreements entered into between the User and WHOW are for an indeterminate period of time should nothing to
        the contrary be determined in the concrete offer provided by WHOW.</p>

      <h4>8.2 Orderly Cancellation</h4>

      <p>8.2.1 Subject to the condition that the period of termination is respected, each party is legally entitled to
        terminate the contractual agreement without provision of any reasons, provided that the following is fulfilled:
      </p>

      <p>8.2.2 If no limited period of time has been agreed upon for an agreement, both parties may terminate the
        contractual agreement in a due and orderly manner with immediate effect.</p>

      <p>8.2.3 If an agreement for using/providing additional virtual features (see Sections 7.1.2 and 7.1.3) has been
        agreed upon for a set period of time (subscription), said agreement shall be automatically renewed for the same
        contractual period, until the User cancels the subscription by the end of the respective contractual period.</p>

      <h4>8.3 Just grounds for cancellation</h4>

      <p>8.3.1 The parties may also terminate the contractual agreement for important reasons at any time without
        prejudice to the above regulations.</p>

      <p>8.3.2 In the event that WHOW is responsible for a premature termination of the contractual agreement for
        important reasons, the User shall receive a pro rata refund for any payments made by them in advance beyond the
        termination date for virtual items or subscriptions that have not yet been credited or booked to the user's
        account or used by the User which apply to the period after the termination becomes effective. All other claims
        of the User are considered invalid unless otherwise specified in these Terms &amp; Conditions.</p>

      <p>WHOW has the right to terminate the contractual agreement especially for, but not limited to, the following
        reasons:</p>

      <p>a. The User culpably violates the law, these Terms and Conditions, the rules of the game(s) and/or the
        Conditions of Participation, and – despite having been warned accordingly – repeatedly fails to behave in a
        proper manner according to the rules and regulations.</p>

      <p>b. The User defaults on the payment of the fees amounting to at least 10.00 EUR and does not pay them despite
        having been reminded of due fees twice.</p>

      <p>c. Third Parties (i.e. social network operators), whose login functions are used by the User to gain access to
        his/her account with the provider, then request the User to delete User data and/or take comparable measures; if
        an alternative form of access would be unreasonable for the provider.</p>

      <p>d. Third Parties (i.e. operators or social networks), whose login functions are used by the User to gain access
        to his/her account with the provider, then limit the access of the provider to the User data, as long as an
        alternative form of access would be unreasonable for the provider.</p>

      <p>8.3.3 In the event of serious violations, an immediate cancellation is permitted without the need for any prior
        warning. A serious violation is an infringement making it impossible for WHOW to continue upholding the
        agreement, thus making it null and void. This is usually the case</p>

      <p>a. if the User violates penal laws</p>

      <p>b. if the User improperly uses the account, games, or service.</p>

      <p>c. if the User provides incorrect information when registering or paying for services that must be paid for.
      </p>

      <p>8.3.4 In cases of cancellations justified by WHOW based on just grounds, WHOW is entitled to demand
        compensation from the User for any resulting damage.</p>

      <p>8.3.5 Should WHOW be responsible for the extraordinary cancellation and the User’s player account still feature
        virtual items, WHOW shall accredit any service fees paid in advance beyond the point in time of the cancellation
        for any virtual items that have not yet been credited or booked to the User’s account or used by the User or
        reimburse a subscription pro rata. Any further claims on behalf of the User are excluded unless otherwise
        determined by these Terms and Conditions.</p>

      <p>8.3.6 WHOW has a special right to cancel the User’s registration for Games or Services in the event that WHOW
        should lose the right to operate these Games or Services, e.g. for regulatory reasons or due to a termination of
        the relevant license agreement between WHOW and the respective licensor. In this case, WHOW may conduct an
        extraordinary termination of all agreements relating to the operation and use of the Game or Service (for
        example, the License Agreement, Agreement on the Provision and Use of virtual Currency or Premium Features,
        etc.) at the time game-play is established. The provision in Section 8.3.5 shall then apply. Any other
        termination rights remain unaffected.</p>

      <p>8.3.7 Virtual currency that is granted free of charge or Premium Features are generally excluded from any form
        of reimbursement.</p>

      <h4>8.4 Termination in Written Form</h4>

      <p>Any and all terminations require the written form in order to become effective (i.e. email)</p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-[#FFCE00]">9. Responsibilities and Other Obligations of the User; Liability for
        Information Uploaded by the User; Copyright</h3>

      <h4>9.1 User Responsibilities</h4>

      <p>It shall be the primary responsibility of the User to pay any and all applicable fees unless he/she uses the
        basic version of the Games and/or Services (see Paragraph 7 above). Furthermore, the User shall comply with all
        applicable game rules and provide accurate and complete information to WHOW upon entering into this agreement
        and through the duration thereof. Therefore, the User declares that all information relating to his/her person
        or other facts relevant to the agreement (especially bank or credit card details) and which he/she provides on
        the User application or during the course of the contractual agreement are complete and correct to the best of
        his/her knowledge. The User is obligated to inform WHOW about any changes to this information without undue
        delay. The User is obliged to follow the game rules. In the case of repeated violation of the rules despite
        warnings to this effect, or in the case of a severe breach of the rules (see Section 8.3), WHOW reserves the
        right to suspend all services immediately and without warning, and to cancel the agreement.</p>

      <h4>9.2 Installation of Software</h4>

      <p>WHOW is not liable for damages or a loss of data experienced by the User on his/her computer, mobile phone or
        other User (mobile) terminal devices (hereby referred to as “terminal device”) used for the Games and Services
        which may be caused by the installation of software that does not originate from WHOW.</p>

      <h4>9.3 Further Obligations of the User</h4>

      <p>9.3.1 WHOW provides the available Games and Services online. WHOW neither provides nor installs any of the
        software required by the User on his/her terminal device, especially, but not limited to, the operating system,
        web browser(s) or plug­ins such as Flash or Java, if applicable. WHOW also does not provide any support services
        for such software installations. It is solely the User’s responsibility to maintain the terminal device in a
        state which enables the use of WHOW Games or Services. Therefore, WHOW does not provide any kind of technical
        support for the installation of locally required software.</p>

      <p>9.3.2 The User is obligated to treat all data provided by WHOW for the purpose of accessing the Games and
        Services (login, passwords etc.) in a strictly confidential manner. The User shall inform WHOW without delay if
        he or she learns or suspects that an unauthorized Third Party has gained possession of said access data. WHOW
        advises the User to do this in written or text form, e.g. via email. In the event that a Third Party gains
        access to WHOW’ Games or Services with the User’s access data because the User neglected to sufficiently protect
        the account from unauthorized access, the User must, due to the danger of an uncertainty caused by him/her
        regarding who misused the account or was responsible for a contractual or legal infringement of said account,
        assume the responsibility for said actions as if he/she had performed these actions himself/herself. WHOW is
        entitled to evaluate all entries into an account with the User's data as the entry of the User into the account.
        WHOW advises that passwords should be regularly changed for security reasons. The User is solely responsible for
        the access to and use of his/her Account.</p>

      <p>9.3.3 In the event that WHOW has a justifiable reason to believe that an unauthorized Third Party is wrongly in
        possession of access data, WHOW may, but is not required to, at its own discretion, change the account access
        data without prior notice or suspend the respective Account. WHOW shall promptly inform the rightful User and
        shall, upon request, communicate the new access data to him or her without undue delay. The User has no right to
        demand that the original access data be restored.</p>

      <p>9.3.4 The User is not entitled to sell his or her account or virtual items to a Third Party or in any other
        way, shape or manner lend or transfer it. The User does not acquire ownership or any rights to the content of
        any virtual items possibly obtained on the portal for a fee, much less free of charge. Virtual items may not be
        transferred or resold in any manner or commercial purposes, including (but not limited to) direct sales or
        auctions. Virtual items may not be bought or sold by any individual or any other company through cash, money
        transfer, or any other form of transaction. Virtual items have no monetary value and cannot be used to purchase
        or use any product or service outside of the platform. Virtual items cannot be refunded or exchanged for cash or
        any other tangible asset.</p>

      <p>9.3.5 WHOW protects its systems against viruses. Even so, virus infections can never be completely ruled out.
        In addition, it is possible that unauthorized Third Parties may send emails using the name of WHOW without
        WHOW's consent, and that such emails may contain viruses, spyware or links to web content which, in turn, may
        contain viruses or spyware. WHOW has no influence over such occurrences. The User agrees to check all incoming
        mail sent or supposedly sent by or in the name of WHOW for potential viruses. The same applies to mails from
        other Users of the Games or Services.</p>

      <p>9.3.6 The User agrees to abide by the instructions of WHOW, its employees, assignees, and vicarious agents,
        especially including but not limited to administrators and moderators of forums for a specific game and/or
        service.</p>

      <p>9.3.7 The User agrees that he or she shall not, under any circumstances, use the Account, login name or
        password of another User.</p>

      <h4>9.4 User’s Obligations Regarding Information for uploading information.</h4>

      <p>9.4.1 The User shall exercise due care in the selection of the information that he or she makes available to
        other Users by uploading it to the Portal.</p>

      <p>9.4.2 The User shall not use the Service(s) to distribute content (including, but not limited to, pictures,
        videos, links, names or words) that contain political, religious, insulting, offensive, violent, sexist,
        pornographic or other objectionable matter, especially including racist, right extremist or left extremist
        content, persons or depictions. In addition, the User agrees not to use any copyrighted or otherwise legally
        protected terms, names, pictures, videos, music, games, or other material. In case of doubt, the User shall
        promptly remove any content contested by WHOW. WHOW is also entitled to remove questionable content of this
        nature on its own. The User shall always respect any applicable laws and regulations, especially with regard to
        youth protection, data privacy, protection of personal rights, protection against slander and defamation,
        copyright laws, and trademarks.</p>

      <p>9.4.3 The User may not misuse the Service(s) for illegal or unauthorized purposes. It is strictly prohibited to
        use the account names or email addresses of other Users without their express prior consent for the purpose of
        sending unsolicited emails, promotional messages or for any other commercial purposes.</p>

      <p>9.4.4 WHOW is entitled to delete any content submitted by the User in culpable violation of the
        above­-mentioned rules and regulations.</p>

      <p>9.4.5 WHOW is especially entitled to delete any information ­in whole or in part which has been submitted by
        the User and which gives firm reasons to indicate a breach of these Terms and Conditions, or if the instructions
        and rules of the respective Service(s) are otherwise in violation of applicable law. This, for example, includes
        but is not limited to:</p>

      <p>a. information which is obviously offensive, racist, fanatical, or glorifies violence.</p>

      <p>b. information which is of a molesting, insulting, threatening, obscene, defaming nature or is libelous to
        other persons.</p>

      <p>c. information which is sexist, pornographic or otherwise harmful to underage persons, or which contains links
        to websites unsuitable for underage persons.</p>

      <p>d. information which is false or misleading and/or which is intended to promote illegal activities.</p>

      <p>e. illegal or unauthorized copies or distributions of a work protected by copyright, for example, by providing
        illegal computer programs or links to illegal computer programs, information on how to bypass copy protection
        measures, illegal copies of music, links to illegal copies of music or other copyright infringements.</p>

      <p>f. the sending of junk mails, chain mails and/or unsolicited mass mails, instant messages, spimming and
        spamming.</p>

      <p>g. limited-access pages or pictures which are hidden or password-protected; promoting or endorsing criminal
        activities or providing instructions for committing criminal activities, including but not limited to
        information on the production or purchase of arms, child pornography, fraud, drug trafficking, gambling,
        stalking, spamming, spimming, distribution of computer viruses and other harmful files, copyright infringement,
        patent infringement and/or theft of trade secrets.</p>

      <p>h. soliciting other Users to disclose personal information for commercial or illegal purposes, or inducing them
        to disclose login data.</p>

      <p>i. promoting commercial or sales activities, such as contests, raffles, swapping offers, classified ads and/or
        pyramid schemes.</p>

      <p>j. providing picture(s) of another person without that person’s express consent.</p>

      <p>9.4.6 The User is not entitled to demand that such deleted information be restored. Furthermore, WHOW is also
        entitled to exclude the offending User from continued use of the respective Service(s) and, in case of repeated
        infringements of the aforementioned prohibitions despite written notice, to terminate the User’s Account without
        prior warning. WHOW reserves the right to make any further necessary and additional claims, particularly the
        entitlement to damages.</p>

      <p>9.4.7 The User shall inform WHOW in case he/she becomes aware of an abuse of the Service(s) by other Users or
        Third Parties, such as making accessible or sending information that violates this Section 9.4. To ensure that
        effective measures can be taken, WHOW requests that such information be provided in writing (e.g. email).</p>

      <h4>9.5 User’s Liability Regarding Uploaded Information</h4>

      <p>9.5.1 The User is solely responsible for any texts, files, pictures, photographs, videos, sounds, music,
        copyrighted or other material, information, etc. (hereinafter “Uploaded Information”) which they upload to the
        Portal or share with other Users. WHOW neither condones nor approves of such information.</p>

      <p>9.5.2 WHOW does not have control over the Uploaded Information on the Portal. WHOW does not evaluate the
        Uploaded Information before it is made public. If WHOW learns that specific Uploaded Information is illegal, it
        shall be deleted promptly.</p>

      <p>9.5.3 WHOW disclaims any liability or warranty with respect to the Uploaded Information, especially regarding
        accuracy, completeness, and reliability.</p>

      <h4>9.6 Copyright</h4>

      <p>9.6.1 The User maintains all rights to the Uploaded Information. By submitting information to the Portal, the
        Games or Service(s), the User grants WHOW a non-exclusive, revocable license, free of charge, to publicly offer,
        display, reproduce, and distribute such information.</p>

      <p>9.6.2 The User does not grant WHOW any further rights to the uploaded information. WHOW is not authorized to
        use or distribute uploaded information outside of the Portal, Games or Service(s).</p>

      <p>9.6.3 By submitting his/her information, the User acknowledges and accepts that the information uploaded to the
        Portal can be accessed globally through the Internet. With the uploading of such information, the User agrees to
        these conditions.</p>

      <p>9.6.4 The aforementioned license ends at that time when the uploaded content has been deleted from the Portal
        and the Services by the User.</p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-[#FFCE00]">10. Claims Based on Defects</h3>

      <p>10.1 WHOW grants the User access to the Games and Services in their current version only (Section 1.2). The
        User has no right to demand the maintenance or restoring of a particular version or range of functions of the
        Games and Services. The User acknowledges and agrees that the Games and Services provided by WHOW, as with any
        other software, can never be completely free of errors. Therefore, the Games and Services can only be considered
        to be defective if their playability or usability is affected severely and over a sustained period of time. Any
        faults in the Games and Services and/or other deliveries of WHOW need to be documented by the User in writing
        along with a protocol of the error messages displayed for the purpose of securing evidence in a suitable form
        (i.e. in text form via an email) and then sent to WHOW. Before reporting a potential bug, the User shall consult
        the instructions for the Games and Services and any other troubleshooting tools provided by WHOW (especially
        frequently asked question lists and boards for troubleshooting). The User shall use his/her best efforts to
        support WHOW in any attempts to debug the Game or Service in question.</p>

      <p>10.2 The User shall notify WHOW in writing of the faults discovered and documented in accordance with Section
        10.1 within 14 days upon discovering them or provide WHOW of notification of defects.</p>

      <p>10.3 WHOW is not liable for defects caused by external influences, faulty handling by the User, force majeure
        or changes or manipulations which are not performed by WHOW.</p>

      <p>10.4 WHOW does not assume any guarantees or warranties.</p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-[#FFCE00]">11. Liability and Limitation of Liability</h3>

      <p>11.1 The User shall be directly and immediately liable to Third Parties for violating any of their rights. The
        User shall indemnify and hold WHOW harmless against any damage caused by his or her failure to observe these
        Terms and Conditions. The User shall indemnify and hold WHOW harmless against any and all claims by Third
        Parties that the posting of any content by the User or any other violations of these Terms of Use by him or her
        violates their respective rights. The User shall also be responsible for any legal costs WHOW may incur as a
        result of the said failure to comply with the Terms of Use, including court costs and attorney fees. This shall
        only apply in the event the User is responsible for any such infringement.</p>

      <p>11.2 Provided that WHOW offers its services free of charge, WHOW shall only be liable for intentionally caused
        damage or damage caused by gross negligence. This, however, does not apply to liability regarding loss of life,
        bodily injury or damage to health, or the assumption of a guarantee offered by WHOW.</p>

      <p>11.3 Insofar as WHOW demands payment for its Services, WHOW shall assume liability for damage caused by intent
        and gross negligence without limitation. In the event of simple negligence, WHOW shall only be liable for
        breaches to substantial agreement stipulations or breaches of a guarantee. Substantial contractual stipulations
        include those that enable the agreement to be properly executed and on which fulfillment the User may rely. The
        above limitations of liability do not apply to liability regarding loss of life, bodily injury or damage to
        health, or the assumption of a guarantee offered by WHOW. WHOW's liability regarding the Product Liability Act
        or within the scope of § 44a of the German Telecommunications Act remains unaffected.</p>

      <p>11.4 The obligation to pay damages or compensation is limited to a slightly negligent breach of material
        contractual obligations as understood in Section 12.3, Sentence 3, for the foreseeable and contractually typical
        damage or loss at the time the agreement is concluded.</p>

      <p>11.5 The above exclusions or restrictions shall also apply with regard to the liability of staff, employees,
        representatives and/or agents of WHOW, especially for the benefit of shareholders, employees, representatives,

        Anything else can only apply if WHOW gives its prior expressed written consent in text form. WHOW is entitled to
        transfer the rights and obligations resulting from this contractual relationship to a Third Party. The User
        shall be informed of any such transfer at least four weeks in advance per announcement at the Portal and/or

        protection provisions applicable in the Federal State in which the user maintains his/her habitual residency

      <p>14.3 Should individual provisions and/or conditions of these Terms and Conditions be or become ineffective,
        this shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions and/or conditions.</p>
